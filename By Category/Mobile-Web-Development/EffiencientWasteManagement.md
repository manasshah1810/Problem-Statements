**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Efficient Management, Disposal, and Recycling of E-Waste
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
E-waste, or electronic waste, is a major environmental and public health issue. By 2025, global e-waste is expected to reach approximately 2.2 billion tons, with only 16%-18% currently being recycled. Improper disposal of e-waste, which contains hazardous materials, poses severe environmental risks as these substances can leach into soil and water, affecting human health and wildlife. There is a significant lack of public awareness about the dangers of improper disposal and limited access to information on responsible e-waste management, leading to increased environmental pollution.

Desired Solution:
Participants are tasked with developing a comprehensive platform to facilitate effective e-waste management and disposal. The solution should include:
<ul>
<li>Web Portal for Citizens: A user-friendly web portal providing easy access to e-waste management resources, including agencies, contact information, and disposal locations.</li>
<li>Web Portal or Mobile Application for E-Waste Agencies: A platform for agencies to manage collection or drop-off requests, assign volunteers, and ensure efficient operations.</li>
<li>Tracking and Monitoring: Features for tracking e-waste from collection to disposal, ensuring transparency and efficiency.</li>
<li>User Incentives: A reward system offering e-tokens or points for e-waste management activities, redeemable at electronic stores or for other purchases.</li>
<li>Awareness Campaign: Tools to educate users about proper e-waste disposal and its environmental impact.</li>
</ul>

Brownie Points:
<ul>
<li>Community Involvement: Features that promote community-driven e-waste collection drives or educational workshops.</li>
<li>Gamification: Incorporate gamified elements like leaderboards or achievement badges to motivate active participation in e-waste management.</li>
<li>Collaboration with Platforms: Partner with online platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, or Zomato to enhance the e-waste collection process and increase outreach.</li>
</ul>

By implementing this platform, the growing e-waste challenge can be addressed effectively, improving public awareness and facilitating efficient management. This solution will significantly reduce the environmental impact of e-waste and enhance overall public health
