**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Smartphone Application for Real-Time Driving Behavior Analysis and Feedback
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Traditional methods of assessing driving behavior for insurance purposes often involve costly hardware installations or are limited by data points. In India, where multiple individuals might drive the same vehicle, accurately assessing driving behavior can be challenging. There is a need for a more accessible and cost-effective solution to provide comprehensive driving behavior analysis. Key challenges include high costs of OBD-II devices, limited adoption of telematics, and the need for vehicle compatibility checks. Additionally, there is a lack of incentives for users to consistently use driving behavior apps and limited integration with insurance systems.

Desired Solution:
Develop a smartphone application that leverages built-in sensors to collect and analyze driving data. The app should include:
<ul>
<li>Sensor Integration: Utilize GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope to monitor vehicle movement and driving patterns.</li>
<li>Trip Recording: Automatically record start and stop times for each trip.</li>
<li>Behavior Analysis: Analyze driving behaviors such as speeding, harsh braking, and cornering.</li>
<li>Navigation Assistance: Provide turn-by-turn navigation to aid drivers.</li>
<li>Driving Logs and Reports: Generate detailed logs and usage-based insurance (UBI) reports.</li>
<li>Rewards System: Implement a rewards system where users earn coins for safe driving behaviors.</li>
<li>Insurance Integration: Facilitate in-app insurance policy purchases, potentially at discounted rates based on driving scores.</li>
<li>In-App Store: Enable users to redeem reward coins for various benefits.</li>
</ul>

Brownie Points:
<ul>
<li>Community Engagement: Features that encourage community-driven safe driving initiatives or educational campaigns.</li>
<li>Gamification: Implement elements such as leaderboards or achievement badges to motivate users.</li>
<li>Integration with Platforms: Collaborate with insurance providers and navigation services to enhance app functionality and user experience.</li>
<li>Additional Features: Include damage reporting and roadside assistance.</li>
</ul>

This smartphone-based application aims to provide a comprehensive, cost-effective solution for real-time driving behavior analysis. By leveraging built-in sensors, the app offers detailed insights into driving patterns, promotes safer driving through feedback and rewards, and integrates seamlessly with insurance systems. This approach addresses the barriers of hardware costs and vehicle compatibility, offering a more accessible solution for a wide range of users. The added features like rewards and in-app insurance purchasing create a more engaging experience, potentially improving road safety and user satisfaction.
