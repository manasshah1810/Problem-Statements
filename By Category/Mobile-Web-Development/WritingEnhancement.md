**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Creative Writing Enhancement App for Children
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Children often face challenges when asked to write creatively on their own, leading to blank stares and difficulty generating ideas. They struggle to initiate their writing process and develop a coherent structure for their thoughts. Providing prompts and questions can stimulate their imagination and guide them through the creative writing process. However, there is a need for a structured approach that not only provides prompts but also helps children learn to generate their own questions and ideas.

Desired Solution:
Develop a Creative Writing Enhancement App designed to assist children in overcoming writer's block and enhancing their creative writing skills. Key features should include:
<ul>
<li>Trigger Questions: The app should present relevant trigger questions based on the chosen topic to help children think more deeply and generate ideas. These questions should be designed to spark creativity and guide the writing process.</li>
<li>Interactive Prompts: Provide a variety of prompts and scenario-based exercises that encourage children to explore different aspects of the topic and develop their writing further.</li>
<li>Question Generation Training: Include a feature that teaches children how to create their own trigger questions by offering tips, examples, and interactive exercises. This will help them develop the skill to generate questions independently.</li>
<li>Writing Templates: Offer customizable templates to help children structure their writing, including outlines, story arcs, and brainstorming pages.</li>
<li>Progress Tracking: Tools for children to track their writing progress and revisit previous prompts or questions to see their growth over time.</li>
<li>Feedback Mechanism: A feature for providing feedback on their writing, including suggestions for improvement and encouragement.</li>

Brownie Points:
<ul>
<li>Gamification: Introduce game-like elements such as achievements, challenges, and rewards for completing writing prompts or generating creative ideas.</li>
<li>Personalized Prompts: Use algorithms to offer personalized prompts based on the child’s interests and previous writing history, making the content more relevant and engaging.</li>
<li>Interactive Tutorials: Provide interactive tutorials or mini-lessons on creative writing techniques, such as character development, plot creation, and descriptive writing.</li>
<li>Peer Review: Implement a peer review system where children can share their writing with others, receive feedback, and participate in collaborative writing exercises.</li>

The Creative Writing Enhancement App aims to support children in developing their creative writing skills by providing structured prompts, interactive exercises, and training in question generation. By offering tools to overcome writer’s block and fostering independent creativity, the app will help children enhance their writing abilities and build confidence in their writing skills. Gamification and personalized features will increase engagement and make the writing process more enjoyable and effective.
