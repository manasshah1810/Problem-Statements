**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Develop Effective Career Counselling and Guidance Programs in Schools to Enhance Student Career Choices
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Background: A lack of adequate career counselling and guidance in schools contributes to poor career choices among students, leading to mismatched skills, job dissatisfaction, and unemployment. In India, many students and their families are unaware of the diverse career opportunities available, often leading to choices based on limited information or societal pressure. Effective career counselling and guidance are essential for helping students make informed decisions about their futures and aligning their education with their career aspirations. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the need for holistic education, which includes providing students with the guidance necessary to make informed career choices. Description: The proposed solution focuses on implementing comprehensive career counselling and guidance programs in schools. This includes training career counsellors, developing resources and tools for career exploration, and integrating career guidance into the school curriculum. Programs should provide personalized counselling sessions, workshops, and access to information on various career paths and educational requirements. Additionally, leveraging technology to create interactive platforms for career exploration can enhance student engagement and awareness. These initiatives align with NEP 2020's vision of equipping students with the knowledge and skills to pursue their career aspirations. Innovative Solutions: a) AI-Powered Career Guidance Platforms: Develop AI-driven platforms that provide personalized career advice based on students' interests, strengths, and market trends. b) Career Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs where students can receive guidance and support from professionals in their fields of interest. c) Interactive Career Exploration Tools: Create digital tools and apps that allow students to explore different careers through virtual simulations, videos, and interactive content. d) Comprehensive Career Resource Portals: Develop online portals with extensive resources on career options, required skills, educational pathways, and job market trends. By implementing these innovative solutions, we aim to improve career counselling and guidance in schools, helping students make informed career choices that align with their interests and the demands of the job market. This approach supports NEP 2020's goal of providing holistic and relevant education to all students.
