**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Conversational Image Recognition Chatbot
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Background: Ever since the birth of AI and computer vision, modeling conversations remains one of the field’s challenges, especially to combine both natural language processing and image recognition. Chatbots are now widely used as part of platform as applications like Apple’s Siri, Google’s Google Assistant or Microsoft’s Cortana. Detailed Description: Generally, a conversational Chatbot is an application that is able to communicate with humans using natural language. However there exists a need for an image recognition deep learning based Chatbot is an application to recognize the images, uploaded by user and answer the questions about the image. The main problem domain of this project is building a image recognization Chatbot, which is capable of recognize the object in an image and generating the best response for any the user’s query about the image. Expected Solution: Image recognition Chatbot is expected to detect the object in the image and have the related dialog of the image after training, also have understanding of the sender’s messages so that it can predict which sort of response will be relevant and it must be correct lexically and grammatically while generating the reply.
