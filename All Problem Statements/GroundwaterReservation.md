**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Development of an educational game (web-based and mobile- based) on groundwater conservation and management
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Learn while you play is considered the most effecting way of teaching. Internet/mobile based games could be one of the best ways to lure school kids, youth and water enthusiasts to learn the nuances of ground water management. With this backdrop it is proposed to develop an internet/mobile based game that teaches good practices in groundwater conservation in an interactive and fun way. The game should take into account various interventions (artificial recharge, microirrigation, crop diversification) and possible scenarios (drought, surplus rain, contamination etc). The gamer can earn points or coins based on the choices that he (or she) makes. The scores of registered gamers will be stored online and water-smart youths can be identified and certified. The game can be used for training and awareness creation.
