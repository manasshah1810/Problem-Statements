**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Development of AI-ML based models for predicting prices of agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetable (onion, potato, onion)<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
The Department of Consumer Affairs monitors the daily prices of 22 essential food commodities through 550 price reporting centres across the country. The Department also maintains buffer stock of pulses, viz., gram, tur, urad, moon and masur, and onion for strategic market interventions to stabilize the volatility in prices. Decisions for market interventions such as release of stocks from the buffer are taken on the basis of the price trends and outlook. At present, the analyses of prices are based on the seasonality, historical and emerging trends, market intelligence inputs, crop sowing and production estimates. ARIMA based economic models have also been used to examine and forecast prices of pulses.
