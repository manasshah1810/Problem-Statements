<li>Audio Q&A: Audio-based questions and answers to help reinforce understanding of key concepts.</li>
<li>Animated Geometric Constructions: Visual and interactive animations to illustrate geometric concepts and constructions.</li>
<li>Interactive Exercises: Practice exercises and quizzes that adapt to the student's progress and performance.</li>
<li>Search and Filter: Options to search for specific topics or filter content based on the student's needs or curriculum requirements.</li>
<li>Progress Tracking: Tools for students to track their learning progress and identify areas needing improvement.</li>
<li>Personalized Learning Path: Recommendations for additional resources or practice based on the student's performance and interests.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and engaging interface that encourages exploration and interaction with the curriculum content.</li>
<li>Dedicated Portal for Faculty: A portal to manage students, notes, syllabus and other required activities.</li>
</ul>
