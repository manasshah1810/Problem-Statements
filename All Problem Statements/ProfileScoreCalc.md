Smart Competency Diagnostic and Candidate Profile Score Calculator
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Project Concept: Comprehensive Employment Platform/Portal The current employment portal lacks a personalized and adaptive approach to job matching and skill development. There is a need for an intelligent system that not only matches job seekers with potential employers but also identifies and suggests training courses to bridge skill gaps. We wish to design a competency diagnostic which would ask a series of questions to students to test their competence and based on their scores in the test, recommend jobs to them and also appropriate training courses to them to cover the gaps in their skill curve. Requirements: 1. AI-Powered Job/Training Recommendation System: • Implement an AI-based recommendation system trained on multiple data points (e.g., skills, experience, preferences) to analyze job seekers' profiles and recommend suitable job opportunities. • Training Course Recommendations: Suggest relevant online courses, workshops, and training programs based on the desired job roles. 2. Skill Gap Analysis and Recommendations: • Gap Identification: The recommendation System should assess job seekers' competencies against the requirements of their desired job roles to identify areas for improvement. • Personalized Suggestions: Provide tailored recommendations for online courses, workshops, and training programs to help job seekers upskill and close identified gaps. 3. Adaptive Learning Pathways: • Personalized Learning: Develop adaptive learning pathways based on the job seeker's progress and feedback. • Content Variety: Offer a mix of micro-courses, webinars, and hands-on projects relevant to the job market to enhance learning and skill development. 4. Real-Time Job Market Insights based on candidate’s skills and competencies: • Dashboard: Create a dashboard displaying real-time data on trending jobs, skills in demand, and salary benchmarks. • Data Analytics: Use data analytics to provide insights into job market trends and forecast future skill requirements. 5. Skills Verification and Certification: • Skill Assessments: Implement a system for verifying skills and certifying competencies through assessments and tests. • Badges and Certifications: Offer badges and certifications that candidates can display on their profiles and share on social media platforms like LinkedIn. 6. Resume Wizard • Automated Resume Building: Develop a resume wizard to help candidates automatically build their resumes based on their profiles, ensuring a professional and comprehensive presentation of their skills and experiences. 7. Community and Peer Support: • Community Forum: Integrate a community forum where individuals can share experiences, ask questions, and receive support from peers and mentors. • Virtual Events: Organize virtual events, workshops, and webinars focused on employment and career development, including special sessions for people with special needs. Expected Outcome: The system will facilitate a personalized job matching process and offer targeted skill development recommendations, helping job seekers become more competitive in the job market. NOTE : This is an innovation opportunity and students are encouraged to think out of the box to develop solutions which can be presented in newer ways + which can address the needs in out of the box ways for a certain industry OR makes the platform generic. Above description serves as a guide to specify essential needs that can be satisfied for the developed solution and is not limited only to the scope described
