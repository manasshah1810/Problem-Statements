<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
The growing concern for the safety of women and the increase in crimes against women in various cities, highlight the need for advanced surveillance and analytical solutions to protect women from various possible threats. We need a promising approach to address these issues through real-time threat detection software.By leveraging advanced analytics through real-time monitoring, Women Safety Analytics should create safer environments for women and assist law enforcement in effectively addressing and preventing crimes against women. The proactive approach of detecting anomalies and generating alerts can play a crucial role in enhancing public safety and fostering a secure atmosphere for women. Women safety analytics software should continuously monitor the scene to count the number of men and women present, offering insights into gender distribution in specific locations and times. It should identify unusual patterns, such as a lone woman at night, unusual gestures and generates alerts to pre-empt potential incidents. Advantages of the system: ? By providing real-time monitoring and alerts, the system helps to create a safer environment for women. ? Early detection enables law enforcement to intervene before situations escalate. ? Continuous analysis provides valuable data to identify hotspots and trends, aiding in strategic planning for city safety Expected Solution: Women safety analytics should include the following functionalities 1. Person detection along with Gender Classification 2. Gender Distribution : Count the number of men and women present in the scene 3. Identifying a Lone Woman at Night time 4.
