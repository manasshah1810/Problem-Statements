**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
AI-Powered Defense Against Cyber-Crimes
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
The rise of advanced technology has brought not only societal advancements but also a surge in cyber-crimes such as phishing attacks, financial fraud, and the proliferation of deep fakes. Between January and April 2024 alone, over 740,000 complaints were registered in India, resulting in losses exceeding Rs 1,750 crore. AI is increasingly being used by cybercriminals to craft sophisticated and hard-to-detect scams. For example, AI-powered phishing attacks now achieve success rates comparable to those created by human experts. Additionally, deep fakes are causing significant damage, with AI-generated voice clones being used to deceive individuals. There is an urgent need for a solution that can safeguard users from these emerging threats.

Desired Solution:
Participants are tasked with developing a platform—whether a web portal, software, or mobile application—that can be installed on personal devices to counteract these threats. The solution should include:
<ul>
<li>Spam and Fraud Detection: An intelligent filtering system that blocks spam messages and calls, detects phishing attempts, and alerts users when they encounter fraudulent links.</li>
<li>AI Threat Analysis: Integration of AI to predict, analyze, and counteract sophisticated threats, identifying patterns and vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>User Awareness: Features to educate and raise awareness among users about potential cyber threats, providing real-time tips and alerts.</li>
<li>Deep Fake Detection: A mechanism allowing users to upload media (photos, videos, audio) and receive a probability assessment of the content's authenticity, identifying whether it is original or a deep fake.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface: A seamless and intuitive interface for users to interact with the platform, ensuring accessibility for non-tech-savvy individuals.</li>
</ul>
Brownie Points:
<ul>
<li>Advanced Threat Prediction: Incorporate machine learning models that continually adapt to new threats and improve over time.</li>
<li>Multi-Layered Defense: Develop a multi-faceted approach combining AI with traditional cybersecurity measures to create a robust defense system.</li>
<li>Community Reporting: Include a feature that allows users to report suspicious activities, contributing to a collective database that enhances the system's detection capabilities.</li>
<li>Chrome Extension: Develop an additional Chrome extension alongside the primary software, offering real-time protection while browsing the web.</li>
<li>Cyber Crime Response Guide: Provide a comprehensive guide within the platform detailing the steps users should take if they become victims of cyber-crime, including reporting mechanisms and recovery tips.</li>

By implementing this technology, safety and awareness among users can be significantly enhanced, leading to a marked reduction in phishing attacks, financial frauds, and deep fake incidents. This platform will not only protect users but also empower them with the knowledge to navigate the digital world safely.
