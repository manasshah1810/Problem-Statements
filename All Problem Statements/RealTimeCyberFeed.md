**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Developing a tool to provide for real time feeds of cyber incident pertaining to Indian Cyber Space.<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Background: NCIIPC shares detail of cyber incidents to corresponding stakeholders in order to inform them about cyber activities related to their IT/OT infrastructure. This empowers them to take necessary actions to mitigate further risk. Description: In order to achieve objective of protecting Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIs) of the Nation, it is very vital to have real time information related to cyber threats and incidents specific to Indian Cyber space. This may enhance the Threat Assessment potential based on the incidents that have already happened or the ones that currently exists. Therefore, a framework to crawl/scrap/collect the cyber incident activities reported anywhere on the web related to Indian cyber space is required to be developed. Expected Solution: 1. Using Machine Learning, find platforms that publish or works as intermediate platform for sharing cyber incident activities related to cyber incidents. 2. Design a model framework for the cyber incidents feed generator which collects data from various forums, paste sites, social media, developer or any other platforms as identified by Machine learning model generated in accordance to point 1 above. 3. Creation of well-structured database of cyber incidents extracted by framework developed in accordance with point 2 above. 4. Generation of valuable insights from the data collected and its visual representation of cyber incidents specific to sectors, APTs and strategic issues.
