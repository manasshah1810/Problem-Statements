**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Farmers Disease Diagnostic/Reporting Portal - Mobile Portal Al Based

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Agricultural productivity and food security are heavily dependent on the health of crops and livestock. Farmers, especially in remote or resource-limited areas, often face challenges in diagnosing and reporting diseases that affect their livestock and crops. Early diagnosis and timely reporting are crucial for effective disease management and prevention of widespread outbreaks.A mobile portal powered by Artificial lntelligence (Al) for disease diagnosis and reporting can revolutionize how farmers manage animal and plant health. This portal enables farmers to use their smartphones to access diagnostic tools, report symptoms, and receive actionable advice. Al algorithms can analyze reported data to provide accurate diagnoses and suggest appropriate treatments or interventions. This technology can empower farmers with the knowledge and tools to manage diseases more effectively, ensuring the health and productivity of their farms. Integrate Al-based software with existing NDLM to allow farmers to submit images and descriptions of disease signs and symptoms. The Al will generate suspected disease/condition reports with preventive measures and send alerts to veterinarians for appropriate action (Al-based software, Mobile application). Expected Outcomes . Enhanced Disease Diagnosis: . Timely Reporting and lntervention: . lncreased Access to Expert Knowledge: . lmproved Farm Productivity. Data Collection and Analysis: Cost-Effective DiseaseManagement: Empowerment and Education of Farmers: lntegration with Existing Surveillance Systems . Community Engagement and Support: Sustainable Agriculture Practices
