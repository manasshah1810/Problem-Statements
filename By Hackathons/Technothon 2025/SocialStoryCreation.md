**Problem Statement Title:**<br>
Social Story Creation App for Enhanced Communication
<br><br>

**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Effective communication is crucial for many individuals, including those with cognitive and developmental challenges. Creating personalized social stories can significantly aid in improving communication skills and understanding complex social situations. However, creating these stories manually can be time-consuming and complex, especially for caregivers and educators who need to cater to individual needs.

Desired Solution:
Develop an online Social Story Creation Web or App that allows users to create and customize social stories in either image-based (comic-style) or video-based formats. Key features should include:
<ul>
<li>Character Selection: A library of characters representing various roles (e.g., family members, friends, pets) to include in the stories.</li>
<li>Venue Selection: Options to choose and customize different settings (e.g., railway station, airport, school) relevant to the story context.</li>
<li>Action Selection: A range of actions and emotions (e.g., hitting, shouting, yes, no) to accurately depict the scenarios in the stories.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface: A simple drag-and-drop interface to add characters, venues, and actions into the story templates.</li>
<li>Story Templates: Pre-designed templates to streamline the story creation process.</li>
<li>Customizable Elements: Ability to modify characters' appearance, actions, and settings to fit the specific needs of the user.</li>
<li>Export and Share: Options to save, print, or share the created stories in various formats (PDF, image files, video files).</li>
</ul>

Brownie Points:
<ul>
<li>Interactive Elements: Incorporate interactive features within the stories, such as clickable actions that provide feedback or additional information.</li>
<li>Multilingual Support: Provide language options to create stories in multiple languages, enhancing accessibility for diverse user groups.</li>
<li>Auto-Generated Visuals: Implement functionality to automatically generate image or video representations of the stories based on the written content.</li>
</ul>

By developing this Social Story Creation App, we aim to empower caregivers, educators, and individuals to create tailored social stories that enhance communication and understanding. The app will simplify the process of story creation, making it more accessible and effective in supporting those with special needs. The ability to auto-generate visuals will further enrich the storytelling experience, providing immediate and engaging representations of the stories.
