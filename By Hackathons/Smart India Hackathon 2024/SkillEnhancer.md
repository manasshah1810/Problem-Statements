**Problem Statement in Detail:**<br>
Project Concept: Enhanced Education System for specially abled Background: Interpersonal skills are learned and mastered by children when they interact with the world, but for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID) this is where the challenges lie. As traditional classroom settings cannot cater to their unique learning requirements, prompting a demand for innovative educational tools that enhance learning engagement and effectiveness. The Virtual Reality (VR) technology which is capable of simulating controlled and immersive environments. It supports safe, repeatable, personalized, interactive experiences with children with unique sensory and cognitive profiles. Existing research demonstrates the potential that VR has for enhancing social functioning in ASD. supporting the benefits of computer-assisted technology on learning and the quality of life for children with special development needs. Description: The Interactive Skills Enhancer (ISE)-a virtual reality software designed primarily for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID) to catalyze their social skills interlaces with their personal growth.
